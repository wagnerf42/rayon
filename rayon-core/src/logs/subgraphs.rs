//! Subgraphs allow to tag tasks.

use super::next_task_id;
use super::now;
use super::RawEvent;
/// We tag all the tasks that op makes as one subgraph.
///
/// `work_type` is a str tag and `work_amount` an integer specifying the expected algorithmic cost
/// (should not be zero).
/// As we know the work and execution time we can compute an execution speed for each subgraph.
/// When different graphs are tagged with the same tag we can then compare their speeds.
/// Slow graphs will see their displayed colors darkened.
/// You can also hover on tasks to display their speeds.
///
/// Example:
///
/// ```
/// use rayon_logs::{join, subgraph};
///
/// fn manual_max(slice: &[u32]) -> u32 {
///     if slice.len() < 200_000 {
///         subgraph("max", slice.len(), || slice.iter().max().cloned().unwrap())
///     } else {
///         let middle = slice.len() / 2;
///         let (left, right) = slice.split_at(middle);
///         let (mleft, mright) = join(|| manual_max(left), || manual_max(right));
///         std::cmp::max(mleft, mright)
///     }
/// }
///
/// let v: Vec<u32> = (0..2_000_000).collect();
/// let max = manual_max(&v);
/// assert_eq!(max, v.last().cloned().unwrap());
/// ```
